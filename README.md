## 🎯 Project Objective
- Practice SQL data analysis on real-world music data.  
- Learn to:
  - Create and manage tables in MySQL  
  - Write queries for filtering, aggregation, and sorting  
  - Gain insights about popular artists, top tracks, and trends

## 📝 SQL Queries Included
This project answers **10 important questions** about the Spotify dataset:

1. **Songs with more than 500 million Spotify streams**   
2. **Tracks that are not explicit**
3. **Tracks with Track Score between 400 and 700** 
4. **Tracks containing the word “Love” in their name** 
5. **Songs by 'Drake', 'Adele', or 'Beyoncé'**
6. **Find all tracks that have more than 10 million TikTok posts but less than 300 million Spotify streams.**
