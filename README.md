# 🎵 Spotify Data Analysis using MySQL

Analyze Spotify track data using **MySQL** to explore trends, top tracks, artists, and more. This project demonstrates SQL querying skills on a real-world dataset.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Spotify dataset (CSV/Excel file)  
- Key columns include:
  - **Track Name** – Name of the song
  - **Artist** – Performing artist(s)
  - **Spotify Streams** – Number of streams
  - **Explicit Track** – Explicit content flag
  - **Release Year** – Year of release
  - **Duration** – Length of the track
  - **Genres / Categories** – Track categories

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Practice SQL data analysis on real-world music data.  
- Learn to:
  - Create and manage tables in MySQL  
  - Write queries for filtering, aggregation, and sorting  
  - Gain insights about popular artists, top tracks, and trends

## 📝 SQL Queries Included
This project answers **10 important questions** about the Spotify dataset:

1. **Total Tracks** – Count all tracks in the dataset  
2. **Distinct Artists** – Count unique artists  
3. **Explicit Tracks** – Count tracks marked as explicit  
4. **Tracks by Artist** – Filter tracks by a specific artist  
5. **Tracks Released Before a Year** – e.g., before 2010  
6. **Top 5 Tracks by Streams** – Highest streamed tracks  
7. **Tracks Longer than a Duration** – e.g., duration > 5 minutes  
8. **Tracks Released in a Specific Year** – e.g., 2020  
9. **Tracks with >300M Streams AND Explicit**  
10. **Tracks Not by 'Taylor Swift' or 'Ed Sheeran' Containing “Night”**

> All SQL queries are included in `spotify_queries.sql`.
